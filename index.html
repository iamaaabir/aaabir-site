    <h1>Abdullah Asraf Abir</h1>

    <p>
        Hello, I’m Abir! I am a Computer Science major at DePaul University.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the moment, I am focused on learning backend development, including concepts
        such as APIs, databases, and how different parts of a system interact behind the scenes.
        I am taking a fundamentals-first approach and aiming to develop solid software
        engineering habits early on.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other than programming, you will often find me nerding out in economics.
        Economics helps me think about the world in a structured way, and I particularly
        enjoy learning about macroeconomic policies and their effect on different
        economic agents.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have experience working with large groups of people through my organization,
        Desire Bangladesh. Managing teams and planning projects is something that I am
        proficient in.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to collaborate on projects or discuss any of the hobbies mentioned above,
        please feel free to connect. I always reply to emails as quickly as possible.
